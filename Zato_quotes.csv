"""Fool! How dare you say you've mastered shadows!?"""
"""How can you touch a shadow? It's impossible."""
"""Ha! You mean to say THIS is the power of a Holy Knight"""
"""When little brats bother me like this, they die!"""
"""...Hmmm. Quite an unusual opponent."""
"""Your massive size is useless against a shadow"""
"""At least it was funny watching you fly around."""
"""My mind can detect and defeat any attack"""
"""And you used to be a hero, old man? Can you even see?"""
"""At last...! Only your blood can ease my soul..."""
"""Remember... My name is Zato-ONE!"""
"""One against one..."""
"""I will show you darkness."""
"""Perhaps this way, I can find something I've lost."""
"""I will protect you. Even by force."""
"""I will protect you. That is all."""
"""If your mind cannot remember, then perhaps your flesh will!"""
"""Don't preach, attack. Before your skill dulls."""
"""Your resolve is second to none."""
"""Please be gentle, sir."""
"""I shall accompany you. However, unworthy I may be."""
"""I sense... discord."""
"""This no longer excites me..."""
"""I do not care."""
"""I pledge this to you, I will become our knight."""
"""Trust in yourself. You are stronger than this."""
"""Surely you jest... Next time you must REALLY fight."""
"""I shall accompany you. However, unworthy I may be."""
"""Guzmania Magnifica!"""
"""Resistance is futile."""
"""I shall remember you"""
"""Nothing to gain after all."""
"""I do not care."""
"""Nothing excites me."""
"""You left me with no choice."""
"""No quarter."""
"""He is so strong now..."""
"""Am I still a child?"""
"""A shame I have no mirror."""
"""Hm. Surprisingly decent."""
"""what do you think, Eddie?"""
"""Amazing that you can mimic me to such a degree, but you are missing all of my experiences in Hell. Shall I give you a lesson?"""
"""As I know all too well, even unlimited power can only be harnessed in a limited number of ways. Not that it matters."""
"""As King of Illyria, you are an ambassador for the world. I am honored to have fought you. Not that it matters."""
"""Everything is so effortless for children... Wait, are you Japanese? I do not know if you will make it in time, but you must head for the colony."""
"""Your ungodly strength is a legacy from the incident in 1999...I suppose it's somewhat amusing? What's with those eyes, Millia? Wait, it's not okay..."""
"Faust: ""You must defeat me. If I triumph, it means fate is nothing more than survival of the fittest."""
"""I envy the way your dedication motivates you, though I would prefer it if that power overwhelmed me."""
"""A mission, a purpose in life...If a heart with compassion had not toppled me, I would have lost as you did."""
"""I won't ask for forgiveness, or for you to let me go. I won't tell you that I wish to turn back time...But I would ask that you let me be with you."""
"""To the best of my knowledge, there is no record of your existence. What is this...?"""
"""Had I witnessed your raging passion before dying, I would have called you foolish. But now? I simply don't care..."""
"""You blade...Only when I've accepted it cannot be seen by the naked eye was I able to survive...It does in fact move at the speed of lig-- never mind."""
"Venom: ""You seem to have recognized your worth. That same recognition is what I now seek."""
"""The power...of course--! Your bizarre 'ki' has tapped into the backyard long before we discovered magic. Naturally...it really doesn't matter."""
"""I apologize, that was completely overdone. Eddie was overzealous of his reunion with you."""
"""After taking this form, I finally understood why you are who you are. There is no need for an answer, is there?"""
"""Interesting. Your delirious ecstacy is the same as mine...though I no longer have a heart left with which to empathize."""
"""Someday you will face a great battle. If this is how you face it, you will not survive."""
"""I see you somehow have a growing attachment to the idea of pain...And my very lack of interest, you fight pleasant. I suppose there are are still areas where I can be useful."""
"""Your fighting skill is tremendous... Why did I not sense an existence like this in the underworld?"""
"""Sure, I've seen through you smoke and mirrors. But challenging me in a mental battle is not the solution. You will most definitely lose."""
"""Records are fascinating things. Their creation is subjective, as is their later consumption--after all, all human activity is seen through the lens of personal experience. That said, I hope that if I am to be remembered, it will not be as human."""
"""I have no interest in your goal, or in the future of humankind, but I will not allow a world in which Millia would suffer sadness."""
"""You're...yes, of course. Irrelevant. I think this is in both of our best interests."""
"""Both the Conclave and Ramlethal could not see the larger plan, of which the Cradle was only a part. Perhaps you were involved in that greater scheme...?"""
"""So, you are to become Justice...Being produced en masse in a world with no borders between others...or living in isolation in a barren world. I wonder which is the worse of the two."""
"""As long as you bark orders to your familiar, you will never achieve the teamwork Eddie and I enjoy. Eddie and I have, through our arguments gained trust for...why does this matter?"""
"""Your attack may appear flashy but are actually quite vulnerable to your opponent's state of mind. Too bad I'm not attached to my 'self', that your tricks will not affect me."""
"""I understand now...Your strength does not lie in your ability to remember, but rather your ability to forget. Can you teach me?"""
"""Well then... Please select a fighter who interests you..."""
"""Darkness itself..."""
"""I don't know..."""
"""A shimmering brilliance..."""
"""It's shining...!"""
"""Ashen..."""
"""Dull, but persistent, light..."""
"""Dazzling...!"""
"""My Millia..."""
"""Somewhat similar to me..."""
"""Dark...It looks like the depths..."""
"""Brightness...but...also some shade."""
"""Venom!"""
"""A muddle of the prismatic colors..."""
"""Ah... Too bright..."""
"""It was dark a long time ago..."""
"""I see something quite black..."""
"""A pure white...Beautiful."""
"""Monotone..."""
"""A powerful light...!"""
"""A charming astringency..."""
"""Achromatic...?"""
"""I can't see anything..."""
"""Half achromatic... The rest..."""
"""Oh... Vibrant..."""
"""A grain of light within shadow..."""
"""I'm bringing you back with me."""
"""From now on, I'm your boss."""
"""Congratulations, you work for the government now."""
"""We were both strong."""
"""I can't call myself your knight if I lose to you."""
"""Where did you learn your Dandyism?"""
"""You are nothing of importance."""
"""Do you not want to try?"""
"""Do you want to discuss terms?"""
"""Beyond all expectations..."""
"""You should start acting more managerial."""
"""You already know every inch of me, do you not?"""
"""I love silky skin, guilty as charged."""
"""Relief could be obtained from embracing a doll..."""
"""If there was murderous intent in your embrace to kill me, dying wouldn't be too bad."""
"""I was just counting something....Carrie...Trevor...Macalore...They're the names of dead members...my subordinates..."""
"""They were good men; I was fortunate to have them, but it's regrettable..."""
"""A refusal...such harsh deadly words from someone so beautiful."""
"""What do you mean by 'too generous'? It would be far too simple for me to send Millia out on a dangerous mission. If I wasn't generous, she'd be heading to her death"""
"""When the Holy War is over...what happens next?"""
"""Exactly. Ten years from now our own Guild will be thrown in upheaval. They'll come to possess a puppet army rivalling Millia's design. Understanding what she is, is the key."""
"""These are nobles. This royal palace ball is a fish tank of sharks, thirsty for blood."""
"""He may be charming but a shark's still a shark. He's the head behind the dissenting faction,
the most charismatic noble within the King's Court."""
"""There's nothing here for you to see at all...Founder.."""
"""To determine if nothing is something, or something is nothing is all part of being an Assassin, Lord Maining.
As you can see, your contract has been fulfilled. But why are you here?"""
"""Now then...You hiding over there, show yourself! I will neither flee nor hide!"""
"""DRUNKARD SHADE!!"""
"""You've been exposed! You're no opponent of mine!"""
"""Amourphus"""
"""Gnehhh...missed my vital points...Millia...in the end she dared to stab me...Heh...I have to thank that woman for piercing me.
That Maining, his agreement was all just an elaborate trap...His aim was to obtain my Forbidden Beast all along.
And if he couldn't do that he'd just use me...That's why..."""
"""...So the child wants a toy of his own, does he?"""
"""Thanks but, that clever commentary doesn't help."""
"""mall talk aside, my Forbidden Beast isn't faring much better. My Shadow is growing weaker."""
"""Missions can lead to accidents...don't worry. Whenever a contract is betrayed, no matter how complex the request it becomes scrap paper.
Your hair was ridiculed as a monstrosity, so vengeance is in order!"
"""For the seeds you scattered to blossom into flowers, obligation and heart are required to observe those seeds so that they blossom."""
"""Got it! DAMNED FANG!! TEAR THEM OPEN!!"""
"""Ah...the Easter Lily in flower language means ""the desire to have children"""""
"""The next time we meet...I shall present you with your defeat, First Assassin!"""
"""Ready my Instant Kill? The Leader of the Assassins needs only ask. Then I shall show you! PIERCE THROUGH!"""
"""So now I have to earn the title of being an Assassin? I'd like to know exactly what my ""senior"" is spouting about now..."""
"""BEHOLD ITS COMING: EXPAND!! AMORPHOUS!!"""
"""Pour me a Sherry. Those punches of his set my soul ablaze..."""
"""I'll say it again: pour me a sherry. It's a drink from my home town."""
"""She and I are not Assassins. We are kindred Forbidden Beasts, weapons born on the battlefield. Money can't buy that!"""
"""One of the Founders of our Guild, lost to time. Even compared to our abnormal talents, he's immeasurably a monster."""
"""Regardless, it is an absolute law! The reputation of the Assassin Guild is bound by the responsibility to carry out ANY task once it is given!
The Guild begins here...the first law which cannot be shaken. A holy law."""
"""To kill a king. With precision.
My shadow will consume him utterly, no traces left behind.
After this...the Guild will be the number one choice to receive children, to be raised as Assassins..."""
"""Living to take hold of what you can to continue to exist, that's what I believe in..."""
"""The Crusades have begun again...even though they started a long time ago...
Assassinations were the prescribed 'cure' to this toxin.
To experience the horror and pain of being raised a soldier within an organization,
and then ultimately become an Assassin as well...that's the history..."""
